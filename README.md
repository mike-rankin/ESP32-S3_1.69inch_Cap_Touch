# ESP32-S3_1.69inch_Cap_Touch

This project uses an 18pin 1.69" SPI capacitive touch lcd found on Alibaba or Aliexpress that has a resolution of 280 x 240. It uses an ESP32-S3-MINI-1-N8 that eliminates the hassle of tuning a chip of pcb track antenna. I had a small amount of room on the board for a gyroscope but the i2c QwiiC connector will help of you want to add other sensors. Instead of a slide power button, the LTC2954ITS8 part uses a momentary pushbutton to turn on or off the board.
